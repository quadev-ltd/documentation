# QuaDev Organization's Repositories: A Research Project in Software Architecture

## Overview:
QuaDev's repositories are part of an ambitious research project focused on software architecture. This project uniquely blends Golang and Python microservices, facilitating inter-service communication through gRPC (a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework).

## Architecture:
The architecture of our microservices is designed around the API Gateway pattern. This pattern acts as a single entry point for all client requests, offering optimized management and routing to various microservices. It enhances security and scalability in distributed systems.

## Authentication:
For secure authentication, we employ JWT (JSON Web Tokens) encrypted with private and public key mechanisms. This ensures a robust authentication process, critical for modern application security.

## Client Application:
On the client side, we use a React Native application. React Native allows for building native apps using React, a popular JavaScript library. Our client app is integrated with Firebase, a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications, which helps in managing data real-time, user authentication, and hosting.

## Testing and CI/CD:
We are committed to best practices in software development. Our approach includes comprehensive testing at various levels - unit, integration, functional, and end-to-end. These tests are an integral part of our project pipelines, implemented using GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). This ensures code quality and efficient delivery.

## Containerization and Cloud Deployment Goals:
In alignment with modern development practices, our architecture is fully containerized using Docker Compose. This containerization strategy not only ensures consistency across various development and production environments but also simplifies the complexities associated with deploying microservices. By leveraging Docker Compose, we orchestrate our containers in a manner that allows for seamless integration and scalability of services. Looking ahead, we are focusing on adopting infrastructure as code (IaC) practices, specifically using Terraform. This shift is aimed at automating and managing our cloud infrastructure more efficiently. The ultimate objective is to deploy and scale our architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS), benefiting from the robustness, scalability, and wide array of services that AWS offers. This move will enhance our ability to quickly adapt to changing requirements and scale our services globally, reinforcing our commitment to building resilient, cloud-native applications.

## Project Aim:
The primary goal of this project is to explore and enhance development practices while researching new technologies. By doing so, we aim to offer a scalable architecture that can be easily adapted for diverse solutions. This project serves as a testbed for cutting-edge technologies and architectural approaches in software development.
